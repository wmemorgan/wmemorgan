# Hi, I'm Wilfred

I help organizations navigate the ever-changing technology landscape. I began my career as a system administrator and worked my way up to IT management. Eventually I started my own IT consulting business which expanded into software development.

I get excited about opportunities to develop software solutions that drive innovation and growth for organizations.
